              <p>We picked the fall because it's the best season, and we picked Grounds for
                  Sculpture because we had a fun date there once.
                  This place has everything: sculptures of people, modernist sculptures that
                  might represent people, and people looking at sculptures. And peacocks!</p>
                <p>Both our ceremony and reception will be at Rat's Restaurant on the Grounds.
                    It's named after the character in <i>The Wind in the Willows</i>, looks like a Monet painting, and is filled with fireplaces,
                    so it's everything Sarah could have ever wanted in either a venue or place to live forever. It's only zoned for one of those, so wedding it is.</p>
