        <p>We picked the fall because it's the best season, and we picked Grounds for Sculpture because we had a fun date there
          once. This place has everything: sculptures of people, modernist sculptures that might represent people, and people
          looking at sculptures. And peacocks!</p>
        <p>Both the ceremony and reception will be at Rat's Restaurant on the Grounds. It's named after the character in
          <i>The Wind in the Willows</i>, looks like a Monet painting, and is filled with fireplaces, so it's everything Sarah
          could have ever wanted in either a venue or place to live forever. It's only zoned for one of those, so wedding
          it is.</p>
