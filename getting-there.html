          <p>
            <a href="http://www.groundsforsculpture.org">Grounds for Sculpture</a>
            is a fantastic 42-acre sculpture park pretty much smack in the middle of New York and Philadelphia. We encourage our guests
            to go early to check it out, or even to go the day before. Tickets are free the day of the wedding or $18 any
            other day.</p>
          <p>The ceremony will take place in the pavilion at
            <a href="http://www.ratsrestaurant.com/">Rat's Restaurant</a>, which is on the grounds and has its own parking lot separate from the main garden. We will
            have a shuttle running between the hotel and the grounds before the ceremony and after the reception!
