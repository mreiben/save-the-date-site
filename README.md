# Save The Date
The site was built by [Sarah Rosenshine](https://github.com/rosenshine) and [Jason Eiben](https://github.com/mreiben) to announce their wedding. They think the game is fun, and know the code is a mess. They promise to refactor it as a part of their 50th wedding anniversary.

The game was built using [Phaser](https://phaser.io).

This site was built using the [airspace-jekyll](https://github.com/ndrewtl/airspace-jekyll) theme.

That wonderful MIDI rendition of Jackson Park Express by Weird Al was made by [Aaron Kesler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSid8QV2Xh4).

The story, names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this production are fictitious. No identification with actual persons (living or deceased), places, buildings, 8-bit plumbers, or products is intended or should be inferred. No dentists were harmed in the making of this game.
